Replication Package: 
Where Should I Look at? Recommending Lines thatReviewers Should Pay Attention To

This reproduce package is created for paper "Where Should I Look at? Recommending Lines thatReviewers Should Pay Attention To".

Description:
There are two main parts in our work. The first part is data process(see data_process folder) part to process the raw dataset and generate csv files. We implement the experiment for this part with Python, Jupyter notebook for IDE and Conda for environment. The second part is data evaluation(see data_eval folder) part to evaluate the experiment result with csv files generated in previous step. We use R and R studio for IDE in this part. The package structure with respect to RQ is as follows:

    .

    │   ├── RQ1_analysis.R.       # Evaluation for RQ1

Getting Started:

System dependencies
For data process part, we use Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
For data evaluation part, we use macOS Big Sur (11.3)

Package dependencies
Packages:

Data Process(Python)	sklearn, numpy, pandas, scipy, lime, time, pickle, math, warnings, os, operator, matplotlib, csv,math,imblearn

Data Evaluation(R)	ggplot2,dplyr,tidyverse,gridExtra,ggpubr

Installing:
For data process part, we save our conda environment file in env folder. Create the new env with file:

conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate YOUR_ENV

Produce:
To get file level model and result: 
run File_level.ipynb from top to bottom in directory data_process/commented/File_level.ipynb for predicting "comment" task
run File_level.ipynb from top to bottom in directory data_process/revised/File_level.ipynb for predicting "revise" task

To get line level model and result: 
run Line_level.ipynb from top to bottom in directory data_process/commented/Line_level.ipynb for predicting "comment" task
run Line_level.ipynb from top to bottom in directory data_process/revised/Line_level.ipynb for predicting "revise" task

Evaluation:

First, please set session to the source code file. For R studio, you can set by session -> set working directory -> to source file location. Otherwise, the program cannot find the files.

To generate the figures in the paper:
Run RQ1_analysis.R  for Figure 4
Run RQ2_file_analysis.R for Figures 3.
Run RQ2_line_analysis.R for RQ2 Figures 5.
